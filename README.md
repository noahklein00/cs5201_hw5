### Automated Tests
You have been provided with a small subset of the tests that your code will
be subjected to.  This is not a substitute for writing your own tests.
To run your tests locally, simply `cd tests` and then execute `./test_main.sh`.
Your tests will also be executed when you push to GitLab.
Do not modify the tests or any of the relevant files.  Doing so will be treated
like any other act of academic dishonesty.
You should, however, modify `myMatrixName.txt`, to include the name of your
vector class.  If the contents of this file are `myMatrix`, the grading
script will assume that you have a header file called `myMatrix.h` which
contains the declaration of a class called `myMatrix`.
