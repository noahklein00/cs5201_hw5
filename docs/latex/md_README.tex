\subsubsection*{Automated Tests}

You have been provided with a small subset of the tests that your code will be subjected to. This is not a substitute for writing your own tests. To run your tests locally, simply {\ttfamily cd tests} and then execute {\ttfamily ./test\+\_\+main.sh}. Your tests will also be executed when you push to Git\+Lab. Do not modify the tests or any of the relevant files. Doing so will be treated like any other act of academic dishonesty. You should, however, modify {\ttfamily my\+Matrix\+Name.\+txt}, to include the name of your vector class. If the contents of this file are {\ttfamily my\+Matrix}, the grading script will assume that you have a header file called {\ttfamily my\+Matrix.\+h} which contains the declaration of a class called {\ttfamily my\+Matrix}.
